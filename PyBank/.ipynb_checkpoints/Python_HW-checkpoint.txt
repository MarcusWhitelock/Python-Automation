Background
You've made it! It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. 
In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required PyBank Python activity, and if 
you wish to stretch your skills even further, the optional PyRamen Python activity. 
Both activities present a real-world situation in which your newfound Python skills will come in handy. 
These activities are far from easy, though, so expect some hard work ahead!



PyBank (Required)

In this activity, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 
You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, 
Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset.


The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
Your final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.






The following is what I came up with before I got stuck not sure if it is correct?

# Importing the path 
import csv
from pathlib import Path
print(f"Current Working Directory: {Path.cwd()}")

# Setting the path using Pathlib
company_data = Path("../Pybank/budget_data.csv")

# Initialising variables
net_total = 0
Avg_change_pl = 0
greatest_increase_profits = 0
greatest_decrease_losses = 0
count = 0
PnL_list = []

# Just formattint the print section 
print("Company Financial Analysis")
print("-------------------------------------")
# Counting total months doing a with open file and saving it as
with open("budget_data.csv", "r") as company_data:
    company_data_reader = csv.reader(company_data)
   
    
    # When complete add this is to write it all to other file. 
    # with open('company_data_analysed.csv', 'w') as company_data_analysed:
    #     company_data_writer = csv.writer(company_data_analysed)
    
    
# Doing a for loop to loop through rows and calculate total by adding 1 every time we loop through a row
    for line in company_data_reader:
        print("Total Months: ", (sum(1 for row in company_data_reader)))
        
# The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
# Doing for loop to loop through rows again  
with open("budget_data.csv", "r") as company_data:
    company_data_reader = csv.DictReader(company_data)
    
    for row in company_data_reader:
        number = int(row['Profit/Losses'])
        count = count + 1
        net_total = number + count
        print(net_total)
