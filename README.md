## Background

You've made it! It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python.

You are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. The dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
